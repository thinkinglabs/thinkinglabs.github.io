                <p>My primary role is "<em>Software Engineer</em>". I code and I am passionate about it. This is my bread and butter. But I am not a Monkey Coder. I do the whole shebang from inception over coding, testing to releasing into production and monitoring the damned application.</p>

                <p>I pay a lot of attention to quality of code and maintainability.</p>

                <p>Without these skills, I cannot be a proper Agile Technical Coach and I cannot set up a Continuous Delivery pipeline. Everything I know, I learned through delivering working software in production.</p>

                <p>Based on the 15+ years of experience delivering software projects I can help teams in adopting eXtreme Programming skills like Test Driven Development, Refactoring, Pair Programming, Test Automation, Simple Design, Collective Ownership, Continuous Integration.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I help organisations and teams achieve a state of continuous delivery, i.e. being able to release product increments sufficiently reliably and quickly to satisfy customer demand. </p>
                <p>It is first and foremost a set of principles and practices to adopt. These will help teams deliver significantly faster at a sustainable pace, with higher quality and lower costs. This involves both technological and organisational changes. </p>

                <p>Continuous Delivery is not a tooling problem. The tooling is the easy part to solve.</p>
