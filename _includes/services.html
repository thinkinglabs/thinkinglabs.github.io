                <p>
                  My primary role is "<em>IT Engineer</em>". I have 20+
                  years of experience. I still code and I am passionate about
                  this. This is my bread and butter. But I am not a Monkey
                  Coder. I do the whole shebang. From inception over coding,
                  testing, setting up the infrastructure, to releasing into
                  production and monitoring the damned application.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I pay a lot of attention to quality and maintainability
                  because that is what makes the difference to make money or
                  not.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Without these skills, I cannot be a proper Delivery
                  Coach. I cannot help organisations achieve a state of
                  Continuous Delivery. Everything I know, I learned through
                  delivering working software in production.

                <p>
                  I help teams in adopting the practices that
                  make Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Based on the 20+ years of experience delivering IT systems
                  that make money I help teams and organisations reach a state 
                  of Continuous Delivery, i.e. being able to release product
                  increments sufficiently reliably and quickly to satisfy
                  customer demand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This means adopting a series of both
                  technological and organisational changes that will help teams
                  reduce stress and fatigue while delivering higher quality
                  significantly faster at a sustainable pace and at reduced
                  costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Which changes to adopt and in which order is specific to the
                  unique circumstances and constraints of your organisation.
                  There is simply no fixed roadmap to the adoption to improve
                  the delivery cadence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This goes beyond automating the delivery. The tooling part
                  is the easy part to solve. It is really about a change of
                  organisational mindset.

              For the past six years, I have been managing the security and
              infrastructure for a fintech to satisfy finance regulation and
              compliance.

              When reviewing the second edition of the book
              <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/infrastructure-as-code/9781098114664/">Infrastructure as Code</a>
              I realised we implemented many of the advised cloud
              infrastructure patterns that reduce risks and increase delivery
              throughput just by applying common sense and lean thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on this experience, I can advise startups and scale-ups on
              how best to leverage the AWS capabilities while keeping an eye on
              costs.

            <p>
              Over the years, I have seen what works and what does not work.
              I have had multiple conversations with fellow coaches, engineers
              from various communities as well as with VPs of, Heads of,
              Directors of Engineering and CTOs and CIOs. I have read numerous
              books and was asked to review books. Finally, I have helped a
              great many organisations in improving their IT delivery. Recently,
              I also asked to run Technology Due Diligence for investors to
              better understand the strengths and weaknesses of technology
              organisations. All that allowed me to build a certain knowledge on
              how to organise a technology organisation that weigh in in making
              money.
            </p>
            <p>
              With that background, I am available as an Interim CTO to help out
              a technology organisation in need of a temporary leader to bridge
              the gap; as a consulting CTO to advise CTOs on how to improve
              their organisation or just as a full fledged CTO.

            <p>
              In this, it is important to understand that everything is
              contextual. What works for one organisation, does not necessarily
              work well for another organisation. Therefore, it is important to
              listen to the people, to understand their problems and start from
              their.
