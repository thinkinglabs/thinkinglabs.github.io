Continuous Delivery brings a lot of value to your organisation. It will allow you to reduce your time to market for new features and bug fixes. It is a significant predictor of company performance.

Continuous Delivery is more than just tooling. It is also a mindset.

During this session we will not talk about how to implement Continuous Delivery. Although you will get a short introduction to it. The session will be more about the mindset you need to have in order to successfully implement Continuous Delivery. And it'll highlight some facts â€¦ And a fallacy (or two) that exist in the minds of decision makers preventing them to take the leap forward.
