Some enterprise IT organisations are adopting Continuous Delivery thinking that tooling is enough to do the job, that all of a sudden they will go faster to market and build quality in because they are automating their existing delivery process.
Just throwing tools at the problem is not enough; to be successful, organisations also need to adopt the right mindset and establish a culture of fast delivery, fast feedback, and continuous improvement.

To successfully implement Continuous Delivery an organisation should adopt a mindset focused around 3 topics:
* How can we deliver faster with less risks ?
* How can we get faster feedback and higher quality ?
* How can we continuously improve our software delivery process ?

Using these topics the session outlines some of the principles and practices behind Continuous Delivery that help improve delivery speed and stability.

The target audience for this talk is anyone involved in the software delivery process and managers of IT organisations wanting to adopt Continuous Delivery.
