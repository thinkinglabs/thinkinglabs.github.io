Feature branching is again gaining in popularity due to the rise of Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) like Git and Mercurial. Although branch creation became very easy with DVCSs, it comes with a certain cost. Long living branches break the flow of the software delivery process impacting throughput and stability.

In this session Thierry de Pauw will explore some of the reasons why teams are using feature branches, what problems are introduced by using feature branches and what techniques exist to avoid them altogether.
In conclusion he explores what exactly is evil about feature branching. Which is not necessarily the problems they introduce. But rather the real reasons teams are using them for.

The key takeaway of the session is an appreciation of a different branching strategy and how it relates to Continuous Integration.
