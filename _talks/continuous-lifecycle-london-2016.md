So your organisation wants to implement Continuous Delivery. But is your organisation ready for this ? Does it have the right mindset ? Does it understand the 3 Ways behind Continuous Delivery? These are some questions you should ask yourself before starting the implementation of Continuous Delivery.

This talk is about the mindset you need to have as a whole organisation in order to successfully implement Continuous Delivery because only throwing tools at it will not do the job. The target audience for this talk are managers, software and systems engineers of IT organisations or anybody who wants to know what it requires for an organisation to continuously deliver.
