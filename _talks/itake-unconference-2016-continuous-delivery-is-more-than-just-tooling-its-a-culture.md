Some enterprise IT organisations are adopting Continuous Delivery thinking that tooling is enough to do the job, that all of a sudden they will go faster to market and build quality in because they are automating their existing delivery process. Just throwing tools at the problem is not enough; to be successful, organisations also need to adopt the right mindset and establish a culture of fast delivery, fast feedback, and continuous improvement.

In order to successfully implement Continuous Delivery an organisation should adopt the right mindset or culture that I like to bring using the 3 Ways of the DevOps culture as explained by the book “The Phoenix Project”.

These are 3 easy to understand concepts that resonate:

* the first way, from left to right: maximising the flow from Dev to Ops to Customers
* the second way, from right to left: constant flow of fast feedback from Customers to Ops and Dev
* the third way: a culture of improvement

<br/>
The talk will go deeper into the 3 Ways. What is it, what does this mean for an organisation and how does this relate to Continuous Delivery and Software Engineering.

The target audience for this talk is anyone involved in the software delivery process and managers of IT organisations wanting to implement Continuous Delivery.

When leaving this talk attendees will have learned about the 3 Ways of the DevOps culture and how this relates to the software delivery process of an IT organisation.
