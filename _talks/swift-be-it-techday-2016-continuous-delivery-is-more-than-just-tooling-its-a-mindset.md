Some enterprise IT organisations are adopting Continuous Delivery thinking that tooling is enough to do the job, that all of a sudden they will go faster to market and build quality in because they are automating their existing delivery process. Just throwing tools at the problem is not enough; to be successful, organisations also need to adopt the right mindset and establish a culture of fast delivery, fast feedback, and continuous improvement.

In order to successfully implement Continuous Delivery an organisation have to adopt the right mindset.

The target audience for this talk is anyone involved in the software delivery process and managers of IT organisations wanting to implement Continuous Delivery.
