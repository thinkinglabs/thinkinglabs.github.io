In this first part of this series, I would first like to investigate what are the practices that enable team work that in turn enable Continuous Integration. Continuous Integration is a practice one achieve as a team and not as a set of individuals.

---

Before we start, we need to make a distinction between what is a practice and what is a tool.

> The difference between a tool and a practice is that a practice only exists when you are doing it.

Tools are very appealing to many engineers because often it is thought that by adopting a tool a practice gets implemented. Though, that is often not true.

Whereas a practice is *the actual application or use of an idea, belief, or method*. It is a codified way of working that might involve some tooling to achieve the practice, but often, it does not.

## Definitions

Throughout this series I am using some concepts that are commonly used in the Continuous Delivery community but might not be known in the broader communities. Therefore, I am going to repeat these definitions in each of the different parts of this series.

- **Commit**: In the context of a distributed version control systems, when I say commit I really mean *commit-and-push*.

- **Mainline**: The line of development in Version Control which is the reference from which the builds of the system are created that feed into a deployment pipeline.
  
  For CVS and SubVersion this is *trunk*. For Git this is the remote *main* branch. For Mercurial this is the remote *default* branch.

- **Commit Build**: The build performed during the first stage of the [Deployment Pipeline](https://continuousdelivery.com/implementing/patterns/#the-deployment-pipeline) or the central build server. It involves checking out the latest sources from mainline and at a minimum compiling the sources, running a set of commit tests, and building a binary artefact for deployment.

- **Commit Tests**: All of the Unit Tests together with a small simple smoke test suite. This smoke test suite includes a few simple Integration and Acceptance Tests deemed important enough to get early feedback on.

## Version Control Everything

We would think by 2022 this would be obvious. It seems the inverse is still true (rolling eyes).

Continuous Integration is a state you achieve as a team, not as an individual. Therefore, in order to work as a team, you need something to coordinate production code, test code, application and system configurations, database schema evolutions, infrastructure code and many other things.

Without version control, we do not have a single source of truth. Releasing a piece of software becomes a marathon of chasing pieces of code on engineer's machines or shared network drives.

Without version control, we may need a team of integrators to integrate the code before releasing. This will lead to far less integrations per day which will impact quality and throughput of the IT-delivery process together with the lead time for delivery and time to market.

Without version control, it becomes damned hard to roll back a deployment that went awry. Because, we do not have that single source of truth allowing us to go back to the last known good state.

If we do not version every single artefact required to create the software application we will not enjoy any of the benefits of Continuous Integration. All of the practices that make Continuous Integration and that are a pre-requisite to Continuous Delivery rely on having everything under Version Control. All of these practices help to reduce the IT-delivery lead time and increase quality.

Be aware, a Version Control System is not only about versioning source code. It is first and for most a communication tool to communicate changes amongst all team
members. Together with Continuous Integration, it reveals the impact on others within minutes. This helps in gaining a [Shared Understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming_practices#Shared_understanding) of the system and building a [Collective Ownership](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/collective.html) over the codebase. In turn this will allow for increased integration frequency. Consequently, this enables communication and collaboration inside the team. In turn, it enables the fast flow of work through the value stream. Inevitably, this results in better quality and a higher throughput for the IT-delivery process and thus for a shorter time to market.

This is the first of two practices that actually need a tool to implement the practice, i.e. you need a Version Control System. The other practice is **Automate the Build**. All other 12 practices to not need any tooling. In the end, to achieve Continuous Integration, you only need two tools. But you will need to implement 14 practices.

## Agree As a Team To Never Break The Build

Get everyone of the team to agree to the following:

> **From now on, our code in revision control will always build successfully and pass its tests.**
>
> -- James Shore, [Continuous Integration on a Dollar a Day](http://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2006/continuous-integration-on-a-dollar-a-day)

I am putting this in bold because, without any doubt, this is absolutely key to the success of achieving Continuous Integration as a team. It will ensure we will have always working software. It will guarantee the code we get out of version control will just work at any given moment in time.

Disclaimer: Of course, this is only based on automated tests. As such it only gives a limited biased amount of information. It only reveals the known knowns. At this point, we do not know if the system is valuable for users and how it behaves in front of the users. This is where manual exploratory testing will add more information. However, not breaking the build ensures that manual exploratory testing can actually happen and that we can deliver a working system to users so we can, in effect, learn how it behaves in front of the user.

That said, it requires everyone in the team to first fetch the latest changes from the remote mainline and **Run a Local Build** before committing into mainline.

This practice is non-negotiable. There is no single acceptable reason that would allow breaking this agreement. Even if production is burning. Nonetheless, it requires to **Have a Vast Amount of Automated Tests** and **Have a Fast Build**.

If we do not get everyone in the team to agree to this, Continuous Integration will simply not work for our team. That is a fact!

> Continuous Integration is a practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently - usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build [â€¦].

## Do not Commit on a Broken Build

<!-- check Poppendieck Lean Software Development and Implementing ... -->

If the build happens to break, we [Stop The Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andon_(manufacturing)) and fix the build immediately.

During the time the build is broken, no new code is added. Adding new code will only aggravate the situation by adding more problems. Fixing the broken build will become harder and harder. Resulting in a situation where the build stays broken a long time. From then on we have just lost the health monitoring for our application which will inevitably impact the quality of our IT systems. Accordingly, we also lost the ability to perform on-demand production releases at any given moment in time which in turn reduces IT delivery throughput and increases our time to market.

## When Broken Revert

One of the preconditions of being in a state of Continuous Integration is to fix a broken build within 10 mins.

The easiest and fastest way to fix a broken build within 10 mins is to revert the commit that caused the broken build. Allowing us to go back to the last known good state of our application codebase.
