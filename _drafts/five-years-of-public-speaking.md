It has been 5 years, I started with public speaking. What a journey it has been.
So many new opportunities, so many interesting conversations and a few new
friends. I have spoken in front of empty rooms as well as jam-packed rooms. This
is a less formal, more personal, emotional writing.

---

The people who know me a bit better are aware I am a rather reserved, shy and
introvert person. I do not like too much attention or being in the spotlights.
I prefer the intimate conversations with a few people and the hallway
conversations at conferences.

You can imagine speaking at a conference, being in front of a conference room is
a rather challenging experience for me.

In the early days, I used to start every presentation with saying something like
this:

> Look, I am shy and introvert. What I am doing here is kind of challenging.
> Please, bare with me.

Just saying that, seemed to remove all the anxiety and all the stress. That
helped me a lot.

Nowadays, after five years, I do not dare to say that any more. I am afraid
people would think: "*Yeah, right. It's been five years he's speaking. Shouldn't
he get used to it?*". Well, actually, no. I am still stressed before my session.
Already when rehearsing, I am sweating like a pig. I feel horrible, very little,
insignificant.

You could wonder: *If it is such a pain, why are you doing this?*

Good question. Although, I do not like the attention of the spotlights. I do
like the attention afterwards. The questions, the congrats, the mentions on
Twitter. That is all very gratifying and enjoyable.

There is another, far more important reason though, why I continue to do this.
In my experience, when you are shy and introvert, people tend to look over you
and treat you as less knowledgeable. The public speaking helped me to become
recognised for my knowledge. Unfortunately, I am known outside of Belgium
and still a stranger for Belgian organisations :/

It all started in 2015. At the time, the manager of the team I was helping to
improve was concerned I never wanted to present the achievements of the team
to the organisation and take the credits for that. I preferred to stay that
"émince grise" in the shadow and have other team members take the honours.

He kept nudging me into that direction. That triggered something in my head. On
one evening, in all craziness, I submitted two proposals at two Belgian agile
conferences. One proposal at each. Two different topics.

> Big Mistake. Big. Huge. I Have To Go Shopping Now.
>
> -- Vivian, Pretty Woman

**Little side note:**

Preparing a presentation takes quite some time. From the metrics I have, it
takes approximately 50 hours. That got confirmed by experienced speakers.
Someone from ThoughtWorks told me [Neil Ford](https://twitter.com/neal4d)
counts 1 hour of preparation per slide. So a 40 slide presentation, which is
typical for the usual 40-45 min timeslot would take you 40 hours. And then you 
have to take into account the additional time spent rehearsing in front of each
conference.

So, you can imagine the work you are facing when sending in two different topics
when having absolutely no prior speaking experience. Doh.

---

Both proposals eventually got selected.

- Agile Tour Brussels 2015: [*Facts and Fallacies of Continuous Delivery*]({% link
_talks/facts-and-fallacies-of-continuous-delivery.md %})
- XP Days Benelux 2015: [*3M EUR later: Moving a team to become Agile in a Company with Too Much Money*]({% link
_talks/3m-eur-later-moving-a-team-to-become-agile-in-a-company-with-too-much-money.md %})

## Agile Tour Brussels 2015: Facts and Fallacies of Continuous Delivery

1 hour timeslot. Massive failure.

I was so stressed I did not sleep the night before.

Far too many slides: 100+ slides. Too much content. I was unable to keep the
content in my head. Eventually, I ended up reading my slides. Such an
embarrassing experience.

---
**Other side note:**

At many open spaces the question is asked:
*How do I start with public speaking*. Many times that same advise is given:
start small, start at a local user group or nowadays at a meetup.
Obviously I didn't do that. Well, it can work. However, I would advise to follow
the above advise: start to speak at a meetup.

---

Although it felt as a failure. It was the start for many new encounters.

[Ben Linders](https://twitter.com/BenLinders) was attending Agile Tour Brussels.
Such a nice chap. I started following Ben on Twitter. From that I discovered
the interview of [Steve Smith](https://twitter.com/SteveSmith_Tech)
[*More Feature Branching Means Less Continuous Integration*](https://www.infoq.com/news/2015/10/branching-continuous-integration/). In that interview I read about
[PIPELINE Conference](https://pipelineconf.info/), a conference on Continuous
Delivery.

2015 was also the year I decided my focus would be to advise organisations in
the adoption of Continuous Delivery. Later, that got extended to Continuous
Integration. So, I definitely had to attend the next PIPELINE Conference.

I wanted to also submit to PIPELINE Conference. But I couldn't submit *Facts and
Fallacies of Continuous Delivery*. Too long. Too much failure. But it had some
very good content.

From that I distilled [*Continuous Delivery is more than just Tooling, It's a Mindset*]({% link _talks/continuous-delivery-is-more-than-just-tooling-its-a-mindset.md %}).

## XP Days Benelux 2015: 3M EUR later: Moving a team to become Agile in a Company with Too Much Money

30 min timeslot. Concise, well prepared content. Good rehearsal. The
presentation just fitted in my head.

I learned from the failure of my first speaking experience. That felt good.

## Attending PIPELINE Conference 2016

Eventually I did not get selected to speak at PIPELINE Conference 2016.

> This was a very good proposal that narrowly missed out. We liked the emphasis upon culture for Continuous Delivery rather than tools, particularly the mention of delivery, feedback, and continuous integration. However, we were uncomfortable with the 3 Ways Of DevOps as the cornerstone of the proposal. Continuous Delivery != DevOps (see http://blog.xebialabs.com/2014/12/10/cargo-cult-devops by Dave Farley), and while using the 3 Ways to drive cultural change is a good idea we would have preferred a different cornerstone that was less DevOps-centric. If the submitter is interested this could be a LondonCD talk later in the year, and we can recommend other conferences if it helps e.g. DevOpsDays
>
> -- feedback from PIPELINE Conference

I have to say, although a very nice feedback, I was pissed off. But well ...
that is not important any more.

I still attended PIPELINE Conference and it was a blast. I was literally blown
away by the quality and the high standard of the presented topics. From that
year on, I attended every edition of PIPELINE Conference till it ended after the
2018 edition. Fow which I was very sad, because it was the one conference that
stood out. In the mean time, I have discovered [Lean Agile Scotland](https://2020.leanagile.scot/)
as a similar high standard conference.

At PIPELINE Conference I met [John Clapham](https://twitter.com/johnC_bristol)
by surprise. Before PIPELINE Conference, John and I were in an email conversation regarding the [DevOps Ball Point Game](https://johnclapham.wordpress.com/2013/11/06/the-devops-ball-point/)
John, [Matthew Skelton](https://twitter.com/matthewpskelton) and
[James Betteley](https://twitter.com/jamesbetteley) developed for their
Experience DevOps workshop. At the time, I was asked to give a DevOps Awareness
training to teams of a big bank. To beef up the training, I stumbled into this
interesting version of the [Ball Point Game](https://play14.org/games/ball-point-game). I gathered up my courage and emailed John my questions. John
was so kind to reply and provide me all the clarifications I asked for.

Did I say I am shy? Even asking a total stranger who blogs (I tend to put people
publishing articles online on a springboard) is a fantastic challenge.

That year, I also met [Matthew Skelton](https://twitter.com/matthewpskelton),
[Chris Ann O'Dell](https://twitter.com/ChrisAnnODell)
(organisers of PIPELINE Conf). Unfortunately, I did not met
[Steve Smith](https://twitter.com/SteveSmith_Tech) that year (also organiser of
PIPELINE Conference). Steve had [more important things on his mind](https://twitter.com/SteveSmith_Tech/status/712171266191597568). It is only at the next edition,
in 2017, I met Steve Smith. From that, a beautiful friendship arose.

PIPELINE Conference was the best thing that happened to me. I got enrolled in
this remarkable Continuous Delivery community. I have met and spoken to some
great minds like [Leena S N](https://twitter.com/leenasn),
[Dave Farley](https://twitter.com/davefarley77),
[Allan Kelly](https://twitter.com/allankellynet),
[Wouter Lagerweij](https://twitter.com/wouterla),

## Continuous Lifecycle London 2016: Continuous Delivery is more than just Tooling, It's a Mindset

I was so proud I was selected with *Continuous Delivery is more than just Tooling, It's a Mindset* for Continuous Lifecycle London 2016 because
[Dave Farley](https://twitter.com/davefarley77) was part of the program
committee. Very first edition of that conference. Very first version of that presentation.

This was going to be my 3th conference. Here I was with my 3th topic in 6 months
time. Oh dear!

Rather "enterprisey" type of conference. They asked for the slides to be ready
one week before the conference. I do not know for you, but my slides still
change the evening before. It learned, most speakers are in that situation.
In the end, that was not a problem.

The nice thing, however, was: I got a conference room manager assigned. At the hotel, the morning I was going to speak, I got a text message saying:
*Hello, I am xxx. I am your room manager. Let me know when you arrive and we'll arrange everything for you*.
Well, that is a very reassuring experience. You do not have to think
of anything. They set up everything for you. You just have to make sure you are
ready to serve your presentation.

The presentation went super well. The room was full. I have to say, having a
full room, even the smallest one, is a confidence booster. After my session, I
got hijacked by Swiss people active in hearing devices (embedded software). They
had a lot of questions about applying Continuous Delivery in embedded software.
Eventually, during several months, we had an email conversation on the topic
which was very enlightening to me too.

At the conference, I had the opportunity to speak 5 minutes with
[Jez Humble](https://twitter.com/jezhumble). He was so kind to sign my copy of
the [Continuous Delivery](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8686650-continuous-delivery)
book. Jez is this lovely person who pronounced my name just right! I was so
impressed. That is very rare. Only the French speak my name right. Well, that
left an indelible utterly positive impression.

Unfortunately, I was not able to catch Dave Farley because I had to leave
earlier the first day of the conference after speaking for family reasons. It is
only in 2018 I was able to catch Dave at PIPELINE Conference.

This time, I reused my presentation at several conferences in 2016. Apparently,
it takes time to learn from thy mistakes.

The high was Agile Tour Brussels 2016 where I was scheduled in the morning
single track. My very first time presenting in front of 125 people. The whole
Belgian agile big league was present. Afterwards, I got the most beautiful
feedback from [Inge Gorgon](https://twitter.com/IngeGorgon): *You may be shy,
nobody noticed that, you did very well!*.

The low was CD Summit & Jenkins Days Amsterdam 2016. I started speaking in front
of 5 people. During the presentation that increased by 100% to ... 10 people.
One advise: avoid speaking at vendor conferences when your topic is not about
the product of the vendor.

## Continuous Delivery Conference NL 2016: Feature Branching is Evil

> I like to say that feature branches are evil in order to get people's
> attention. However in reality I lack the determination and confidence to be a
> zealot. So here is the non-soundbite version.
>
> -- Jez Humble, [On DVCS, continuous integration, and feature branches](https://continuousdelivery.com/2011/07/on-dvcs-continuous-integration-and-feature-branches/)

Let me fix that for you! I might have been a bit pretentious on this one.

I selected Continuous Delivery Conference NL because [Steve Smith](https://twitter.com/SteveSmith_Tech)
had spoken at it the year before. Knowing people you value having spoken at a
conference before is usually a quality indication about that conference.

I submitted two topics:

- [*Continuous Delivery is more than just Tooling, It's a Mindset*]({% link _talks/continuous-delivery-is-more-than-just-tooling-its-a-mindset.md %})
- [*Feature Branching is Evil*]({% link _talks/feature-branching-considered-evil.md})

Because of the "enterprisey" character of the conference, I was expecting they
would select *Continuous Delivery is more than just Tooling, It's a Mindset*.
Well no! They went for the provocative topic. Look at that!

One month before, I attended the SoCraTes France 2016 open space conference for
the very first time.

Again I gathered up my courage and proposed a *Feature Branching is Evil*
session at SoCraTes France. You have to know, at the time, I did not have the
confidence I have now to handle that subject. You also have to know that at such
conferences, most attendees do you feature branches. My purpose of having that
session was to gather as much feedback as possible from proponents of branching.
The night before I drafted in 3 hours a draft of my presentation. That session
helped a tremendously in organising my thoughts and producing the very first
version for Continuous Delivery Conference NL.

At Continuous Delivery Conference NL, I was scheduled as the last session of the
day. Bummer. I will not be able to enjoy the other sessions at the conference.
As long as I have not served my session, it takes all my attention away.

The session was a success. That evening, I published my slides on Twitter.
Something unexpected happened. A retweet storm happened by all the people I
admire.

## XP Conference 2017

That gave me the confidence to submit at XP Conference 2017. I have this
out-of-nowhere, indescribable idea some conference are just out of my reach. XP
is one of them, together with Agile20xx, Lean Agile Scotland and Agile India.

Did I mention [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)?

The XP Conference uses the [perfection game](https://www.benlinders.com/2014/getting-feedback-with-the-perfection-game/)
for feedback on sessions. That helped me to great extent in creating a decent
session submission. Ever since, I use
[this template](https://submissions.agilealliance.org/xp2017/sessions/5106)
for submissions.

In the end, I got selected for XP Conference 2017. Wow. So proud.

On my way to XP Conference, the slides improved. Missing pictures were added to
the slides.

At XP Conference I met [Giovanni Asproni](https://twitter.com/gasproni). I had
both hilarious moments and very serious discussions with Giovanni. Good
memories. It took another 2 years before I met Giovanni again in 2019
in Milan at CodeMotion where we were both speaking.

XP Conference was also my first encounter with
[Nick Tune](https://twitter.com/ntcoding)
and [Alberto Brandolini](https://twitter.com/ziobrando).

For some mysterious reason, the presentation at XP Conference got quite some
attention on Twitter. It even got mentioned in
[Gareth Rushgrove](https://twitter.com/garethr)'s
[DevOps Weekly](https://www.devopsweekly.com/).

> A solid argument against feature branching, arguing that there are many ways
> of using a distributed version control system, not all of them good.
>
> -- Gareth Rushgrove, DevOps Weekly [#335](https://devopsweeklyarchive.com/335/)

2017 was becoming a rather lean year from a public speaking perspective. I was
rejected from many conferences.

Then, out of the blue, I receive this email from
[Mikalai Alimenkou](https://twitter.com/xpinjection)
having the subject: "*XP Days Ukraine 2017 speaker invitation*". You can
imagine my surprise.

> We have found your talk about feature branches in XP 2017 conference program
> and decided it could be interesting for our community.
>
> -- Mikalai Alimenkou

This, together with XP Conference made my year. Proud.

Bonus: [XP Days Ukraine recorded my session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4DM-Wa0aDQ).
I finally had a video of me presenting. For some reason it pops up now and then
on Twitter and got almost 5.000 views 🤷‍♂️

## CodeMotion Milan 2018

Because I only presented *Feature Branching is Evil* at two conferences in 2017.
And because I thought the world had to hear about the evilness of feature
branching, I decided to continue for another year to submit this presentation.

2018 was a packed year. I spoke at 14 events, conferences, meetups and even
paying speaking assignments at company events.

I would never have thought when starting this journey, one day I would be paid
by companies to present.

The highs of 2018 were speaking at Agile India, NCrafts and Lean Agile
Scotland. As said, I have the tendency to put some conferences on a pedestal.

The absolute high was CodeMotion Milan 2018.

> -- Thierry de Pauw, [Sep 26, 2018](https://twitter.com/tdpauw/status/1045043533693022208)

I've tried many times to submit "*Feature Branching is Evil*" at what I call
pure developer oriented conferences like NDC, OreDev, Devoxx, BuildStuff.
Because, IMHO this the audience that needs this information. As opposed to
agile, XP or software-crafts conferences where I have the impression to preach
in front of the convinced. But, "*Feature Branching is Evil*" was always
rejected. I do not know why. Obviously you do not receive any feedback.

I do not mind being rejected. I do mind not receiving any feedback because of
the fallacy reason "*we have received too many proposals*". I get it, it takes
time to reply to everyone having proposed. But it is a sign of respect towards
the time these persons have put into crafting a proposal for your conference.

I remember Steve Smith making a point of personally informing each and every
submitter why they were not selected for PIPELINE Conference.

Never mind, so CodeMotion Milan was an absolute success. They scheduled me in
the smallest room. I remember thinking: "*I can imagine in this kind of
conference less people will be interested*".

> Thierry de Pauw live in very shortly at Room 3. Make sure to get down to the

That room was jam-packed. People were sitting on the floor in front of the
stage and other standing the back! 😳 Afterwards, I learned that room had a
capacity of 300 seats. 300 seats! 😳

2018 is also the year I learned, avoid submitting an abstract for which you
have no material yet and you know you do not have the time to put together
a presentation. [Seb Rose](https://twitter.com/sebrose) nudged me to propose a
follow up to "*Feature Branching is Evil*" with code examples to XP Conference
2018 and Agile 2018. Guess what? They both got selected 🤦‍♂️ There I was.
Eventually, I decided to cancel both.

## Expand Conf 2019: Continuous Delivery for 15 teams and there single monolith

It is only in late 2019 I came up with a new subject thanks to
[Jeffrey Fredrick](https://twitter.com/Jtf) and
[Douglas Squirrel](https://twitter.com/douglassquirrel):
[*Continuous Delivery for 15 teams and there single monolith*]({% link _talks/15-teams-1-monolith-4-months-to-achieve-continuous-delivery.md %})

That year I organised CITCON 2019 in my home town, Ghent. Jeffrey is the founder
of CITCON together with [Paul Julius](https://twitter.com/PaulJulius) (aka PJ).
Douglas (aka Squirrel) is a long time attendee of CITCON and together with
Jeffrey is the co-author of the book
[Agile Conversations](https://www.conversationaltransformation.com/agile-conversation-book/).

Squirrel did a session on Agile War stories. One of the attendees mentioned the
work I was doing at his employer. At the time I was helping a federal public
agency adopting Continuous Delivery for 15 teams working at a single monolith.
Continuous Delivery was achieved in less than 4 months.

Squirrel immediately grabbed me asking: "*How did you manage their fear?*".
This became the fear conversation case in their book Agile Conversations. Proud!

## Agile Tour Vilnius 2020: I have 99 Problems. Where do I start? Theory of Constraints applied

At SoCraTes Germany 2019, my dear friend
[Tobias Goeschel](https://twitter.com/w3ltraumpirat) and I gave an
improvised introductory session on Theory of Constraints. That had quite some
success. Back then, we thought, we should turn this into a presentation. It
took some time to realise. But eventually, we presented this at several
online conferences at the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021.

I have to say, being the two to present is far less stressful than presenting
alone.

Preparing that presentation was lots of fun. Tobias and I met each other at
SoCraTes France in 2016. A click happened. We
enjoy our conversations. Ever since, we met at least once a year at SoCraTes
France. This is another beautiful friendship I deeply care of.

## Final Thoughts

Looking back, this was quite a journey. It unlocked experiences
I would never had ran into, had I never submitted my first proposal in 2015.

I have been invited to speak at several conferences. For an imposter,
this is quite an experience. It really butters up your ego. I can use that.

I have been asked to review two books. One of my work experiences is mentioned
as a case in another book.

I have travelled a lot. Spoken with lots of interesting people. I am proud of
what I have done.

Over 5 years, I have spoken at xxx conferences. Though, I have spoken so many
times and I am seen as an experienced speaker by some, I am and will still freak
out to the idea of speaking public. I just do not get used to it. But, it is
worth the investment.

## Acknowledgment

To Els, the one I love since I am 15 years, who made all of this possible.
Thank you my dear!
