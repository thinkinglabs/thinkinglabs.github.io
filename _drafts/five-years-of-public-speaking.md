It has been 5 years, I started with public speaking. This is my journey into
public speaking. My highs and my lows. This will be a more personal, emotional
writing. I hope this will help others thinking of public speaking to make the
leap forward.

---

Those who know me a know I am a rather reserved, shy and introvert person. I do
not like attention or being in the spotlights.
I prefer the intimate conversations with a few people I feel at ease with and
the hallway conversations at conferences.

You can imagine speaking at a conference, on a stage in front of a room full
of people is a rather challenging experience for me. Let me be clear,
"*challenging*" is an understatement.

At the start of my public speaking journey, I used to start every presentation
saying something along the lines of:

> Look, I am shy and introvert. What I am doing here is kind of demanding.
> Please, bare with me.

Having said that, seemed to remove all the anxiety and stress. That
helped me a lot.

Nowadays, after five years, I do not dare to say that any more. I am afraid
people would think: "*Yeah, right. It's been five years he's speaking. Shouldn't
he get used to it?*". Well no. I do not get used to this. I am still stressed
before my session. When rehearsing, I am already sweating like a pig. I feel
horrible, very little and very insignificant. Why am I doing this?

You can wonder: *If it is such a pain, why are you doing this?*

Good question. Although, I do not like the spotlights. I do like the attention
afterwards. The questions, the congrats, the mentions on Twitter, the requests
for advise. That is all very gratifying and enjoyable. It is a tremendous ego
boost.

There is however another, far more important reason why I continue doing this.
In my experience, when you are shy and introvert, people tend to look over you.
They tend to treat you as less knowledgeable. Public speaking helped me to
become recognised for my knowledge. Unfortunately, I am still a stranger for
Belgian organisations 😒 although I am quite known outside of Belgium.

It all started in 2015. At the time, I was helping a team of 10 people with
improving their software engineering skills. The team manager was concerned I
never wanted to present the achievements of the team to the organisation. He
wanted me to also take credit. I preferred to stay this "émince grise" in the
shadow and have the other team members take the honours.

He kept nudging me into that direction. Finally, it triggered something. On
one night, in all my craziness, I submitted two proposals at two Belgian agile
conferences. One proposal per conference. Two different topics.

> Big mistake. Big. Huge. I have to go shopping now.

**Little side note on preparation time for presentations:**

Preparing a presentation takes quite some time. From the metrics I have, it
takes approximately 50 hours for a 40-45 min session. That is about 40 slides.
Experienced speakers confirmed this to me.

[James Lewis](https://twitter.com/boicy) from ThoughtWorks told me
[Neil Ford](https://twitter.com/neal4d) counts 1 hour of preparation per slide.
A 40 slides presentation, would take 40 hours preparation. And then you have not
yet taken the additional time spent rehearsing in front of each and every
conference into account.

You can imagine the work you are facing when sending in two different topics
and having absolutely no prior speaking experience. Doh 🤦

Both proposals got selected.

- Agile Tour Brussels 2015: [*Facts and Fallacies of Continuous Delivery*]({% link

- XP Days Benelux 2015: [*3M EUR later: Moving a team to become Agile in a Company with Too Much Money*]({% link
_talks/3m-eur-later-moving-a-team-to-become-agile-in-a-company-with-too-much-money.md %})

## Agile Tour Brussels 2015: Facts and Fallacies of Continuous Delivery

1 hour timeslot. Massive failure.

I was so stressed I did not sleep the night before.

Far too many slides: 100+. Too much content. I was unable to keep the
content in my head. Eventually, I ended up reading my slides. Such an
embarrassing experience.

---
**Side note on how to start with public speaking:**

At many open spaces the question get asked:
*How do I start with public speaking*. Many times the exact same advise is
given: start small, start at a local user group or a meetup.
It seems I have not done this. Well, it works. However, I would advise to follow
the above advise: start to speak at a meetup. It will be less stressful.

---

Although it felt as a failure. It was the start for many new encounters.

[Ben Linders](https://twitter.com/BenLinders) was attending Agile Tour Brussels.
Such a nice man. I started following Ben on Twitter. From that I discovered
the interview with [Steve Smith](https://twitter.com/SteveSmith_Tech)
[*More Feature Branching Means Less Continuous Integration*](https://www.infoq.com/news/2015/10/branching-continuous-integration/). The original interview mentioned
[PIPELINE Conference](https://pipelineconf.info/), a conference on Continuous
Delivery.

2015 was also the year I decided to focus on advising organisations in
the adoption of Continuous Delivery. Later, I extended this to Continuous
Integration. It seems there is still plenty of work to do in that area. That
meant I definitely had to attend the next PIPELINE Conference.

I also wanted to submit to PIPELINE Conference. But I could not submit
*Facts and Fallacies of Continuous Delivery*. Too long. Too much linked with
failure. But it had interesting content.

From that I distilled [*Continuous Delivery is more than just Tooling, It's a
Mindset*]({% link _talks/continuous-delivery-is-more-than-just-tooling-its-a-mindset.md %}).

---

**Side note on writing a proposal:**

When you have never done this, writing a proposal is not easy. At least it
was not for me. Luckily, there are nice people online willing to help you with
that.

Have a look at [HelpMeAbstract](https://helpmeabstract.com/).

## XP Days Benelux 2015: 3M EUR later: Moving a team to become Agile in a Company with Too Much Money

30 min timeslot. Concise, well prepared, good rehearsal. The presentation just
fitted into my head.

I learned from the failure of my first speaking experience. That went very well.

## Attending PIPELINE Conference 2016

In the end I did not get selected to speak at
[PIPELINE Conference](https://pipelineconf.info/) 2016.

> This was a very good proposal that narrowly missed out. We liked the emphasis upon culture for Continuous Delivery rather than tools, particularly the mention of delivery, feedback, and continuous integration. However, we were uncomfortable with the 3 Ways Of DevOps as the cornerstone of the proposal. Continuous Delivery != DevOps (see http://blog.xebialabs.com/2014/12/10/cargo-cult-devops by Dave Farley), and while using the 3 Ways to drive cultural change is a good idea we would have preferred a different cornerstone that was less DevOps-centric. If the submitter is interested this could be a LondonCD talk later in the year, and we can recommend other conferences if it helps e.g. DevOpsDays
>
> -- feedback from PIPELINE Conference

I have to say, this was lovely feedback, but I was a bit pissed off. Because of
that DevOps thingy. But well ... that is not important any more.

I still attended PIPELINE Conference and it was a blast. I was literally blown
away by the quality and the high standard of the presented topics. From that
year on, I attended every edition of PIPELINE Conference till it ended after the
2018 edition. For which I was very sad. It was the one conference that stood
out where I got my butter. In the mean time, I discovered
[Lean Agile Scotland](https://2020.leanagile.scot/) with similar high standards.

At PIPELINE Conference I stumbled into
[John Clapham](https://twitter.com/johnC_bristol). Before PIPELINE Conference,
John and I were in an email conversation regarding the
[DevOps Ball Point Game](https://johnclapham.wordpress.com/2013/11/06/the-devops-ball-point/)
John, [Matthew Skelton](https://twitter.com/matthewpskelton) and
[James Betteley](https://twitter.com/jamesbetteley) developed for their
Experience DevOps workshop. At the time, I was asked to give a DevOps Awareness
training to teams of a bank. To make the training a bit more interactive, I
searched for ideas and stumbled into this attractive version of the
[Ball Point Game](https://play14.org/games/ball-point-game).
I gathered up my courage and emailed John all of my questions. John
was so friendly to reply and provide me all the clarifications I asked for.

Did I say I am shy? Even asking a total stranger who blogs is a fantastic
challenge. You have to know I tend to put people writing articles online on a
springboard.

That year, I got to know the organisers of PIPELINE Conference:
[Matthew Skelton](https://twitter.com/matthewpskelton),
[Chris Ann O'Dell](https://twitter.com/ChrisAnnODell). Unfortunately,
[Steve Smith](https://twitter.com/SteveSmith_Tech) was not present that year.
Steve had [more important things on his mind](https://twitter.com/SteveSmith_Tech/status/712171266191597568). I had to wait for the next edition,
in 2017, to meet Steve Smith. In 2017, we closed the conference at midnight.
From that, a beautiful friendship arose.

PIPELINE Conference is the best thing that happened to me. I got enrolled in
this remarkable Continuous Delivery community. I have met and spoken to some
great minds like [Leena S N](https://twitter.com/leenasn),
[Dave Farley](https://twitter.com/davefarley77),
[Allan Kelly](https://twitter.com/allankellynet),
[Wouter Lagerweij](https://twitter.com/wouterla),

## Continuous Lifecycle London 2016: Continuous Delivery is more than just Tooling, It's a Mindset

[Dave Farley](https://twitter.com/davefarley77) was a member of the program
committee for
[Continuous Lifecycle London](https://www.continuouslifecycle.london/) 2016.

You can imagine how proud I was hearing I was selected with
[*Continuous Delivery is more than just Tooling, It's a Mindset*]({% link _talks/continuous-delivery-is-more-than-just-tooling-its-a-mindset.md %})

This was the very first edition of Continuous Lifecycle London. And the very
first version of that presentation.

This was going to be my 3th conference. Here I was with a 3th topic in 6 months
time. Oh dear!

Continuous Lifecycle felt as a rather "enterprisey" type of conference. They
asked to submit the slides one week before the conference. Well, most of the
time, my slides still change the evening before. By and by, that was not
really a problem.

The nice thing, however, was: I got a conference room manager assigned. The
morning of my presentation, I received a text message saying:
*Hello, I am xxx. I am your room manager. Let me know when you arrive and we'll
arrange everything for you*.
That feeling of being taken care of is so reassuring. You do not have to think
of anything. They set up everything for you. You just have to make sure you are
ready to serve your presentation.

The presentation went super well. The room was full. Speaking in front of a
full room, even the smallest one, is a confidence booster. After my session, I
got hijacked by Swiss people active in hearing devices (embedded software). They
had a lot of questions about applying Continuous Delivery with embedded
software. This resulted in an email conversation on the topic that lasted for
several months. That was very enlightening for me. Yet another beautiful
experience.

This time, I reused my presentation for several other conferences in 2016.
Apparently, it takes time to learn from your mistakes 🙄.

The high of that year was
[Agile Tour Brussels](http://www.agiletourbrussels.be/) 2016 where I was
scheduled in the morning single track. My very first time presenting in front of
125 people. The whole Belgian agile big league was present. Afterwards,
[Inge Gorgon](https://twitter.com/IngeGorgon) gave me the sweetest feedback:
*You may be shy, nobody noticed that, you did very well!*.

The low of that year was CD Summit & Jenkins Days Amsterdam 2016. I started
speaking in front of 5 people. During the presentation that increased by 100% to
... 10 people. One advise: avoid speaking at vendor conferences when your topic
is not about the product of the vendor.

## Continuous Delivery Conference NL 2016: Feature Branching is Evil

> I like to say that feature branches are evil in order to get people's
> attention. However in reality I lack the determination and confidence to be a
> zealot. So here is the non-soundbite version.
>
> -- Jez Humble, [On DVCS, continuous integration, and feature branches](https://continuousdelivery.com/2011/07/on-dvcs-continuous-integration-and-feature-branches/)

Let me fix that for you! Alright, I might have been a bit pretentious on this
one. To be faire, I absolutely did not realise what I was starting.

I wanted to speak at Continuous Delivery Conference NL because
[Steve Smith](https://twitter.com/SteveSmith_Tech)
had spoken at Continuous Delivery Conference NL the year before. Knowing people
you value have spoken at a conference before is usually a good sign of the
quality of a conference.

I submitted two topics:

- [*Continuous Delivery is more than just Tooling, It's a Mindset*]({% link _talks/continuous-delivery-is-more-than-just-tooling-its-a-mindset.md %})
- [*Feature Branching is Evil*]({% link _talks/feature-branching-considered-evil.md %})

Continuous Delivery Conference NL also radiated an "enterprisey" character. I
was expecting, if I get selected, they would select *Continuous Delivery is more
than just Tooling, It's a Mindset*. Well no! They went for the provocative
topic. Look at that! The journey was going to start.

One month before speaking at Continuous Delivery Conference NL, I attended the
[SoCraTes France](https://socrates-fr.github.io/) 2016 open space conference for
the very first time.

Again I gathered up my courage and proposed a *Feature Branching is Evil*
session at SoCraTes France. You have to know, at the time, I did not have the
confidence I have now to treat the subject. In addition, most attendees of
such conference use feature branches. I was expecting some backfire. But my
purpose of having that session was to gather as much feedback as possible from
proponents of branching. The night before I drafted in 3 hours a draft of my
presentation. The session helped tremendously in organising my thoughts and
producing the very first version for Continuous Delivery Conference NL.

At Continuous Delivery Conference NL, I was scheduled as the last session of the
day. That was a bummer. I have a hard time enjoying the conference as long as I
have not given my presentation. At last, the session went well.

That evening, I published my slides on Twitter. Something unexpected happened.
A retweet storm happened from all the people I admire. 😳

## XP Conference 2017

Continuous Delivery Conference NL and Twitter gave me the confidence to submit
at [XP Conference 2017](https://www.agilealliance.org/xp2017/). I have this
irrational idea some conferences are just out of my reach. XP Conference
is one of them, together with Agile20xx, Lean Agile Scotland and Agile India.

Did I mention [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)?

Before submitting, I made use of the ask for feedback option.
[Dana Pylayeva](https://twitter.com/DanaPylayeva) gave me
[constructive feedback](https://submissions.agilealliance.org/xp2017/sessions/5106/reviews/8371#end_of_session)
on how to improve my proposal to become an excellent proposal. Ever since, I use
[this template](https://submissions.agilealliance.org/xp2017/sessions/5106)
for all my submissions.

In the end, I got selected for XP Conference 2017. Wow. So proud.

On the Thalys to XP Conference and at the hotel that night, I improved the
slides by adding the required illustrations.

> your use of illustrations was very effective

> -- Jeff Sussna, [May 24, 2017](https://twitter.com/jeffsussna/status/867392165336502273)

At XP Conference I met [Giovanni Asproni](https://twitter.com/gasproni). I had
both hilarious moments and very serious discussions with Giovanni. Good
memories. It took another 2 years before I could meet Giovanni again in 2019
in Milan at CodeMotion where we were both speaking.

For some mysterious reason, the presentation at XP Conference received quite
some attention on Twitter. It even got mentioned in
[Gareth Rushgrove](https://twitter.com/garethr)'s
[DevOps Weekly](https://www.devopsweekly.com/).

> A solid argument against feature branching, arguing that there are many ways
> of using a distributed version control system, not all of them good.
>
> -- Gareth Rushgrove, DevOps Weekly [#335](https://devopsweeklyarchive.com/335/)

2017 was becoming a rather lean year from a public speaking perspective. I was
rejected from many conferences.

Then, out of the blue, I received this email from
[Mikalai Alimenkou](https://twitter.com/xpinjection)
with as subject: "*XP Days Ukraine 2017 speaker invitation*". You can
imagine my surprise.

> We have found your talk about feature branches in XP 2017 conference program
> and decided it could be interesting for our community.
>
> -- Mikalai Alimenkou

This, together with XP Conference made my year. Proud.

On top of that, there was a bonus.
[XP Days Ukraine recorded my session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4DM-Wa0aDQ).
I finally had a video of me presenting. For some reason it pops up now and then
on Twitter. It almost reached 5.000 views. 🤷‍♂️

By the end of 2017, [Leena S N](https://twitter.com/leenasn) nudged me to submit
at [Agile India 2018](https://2018.agileindia.org/). I did and thought we will
see. We will see turned out to become, I am travelling to India in 2018. 😳
That was a wonderful experience I will never forget.

## CodeMotion Milan 2018

In one year, I only presented *Feature Branching is Evil* at 3 conferences. My
believe was the world had to hear more about the evilness of feature
branching. I decided to continue for another year to submit this presentation.

2018 was a packed year. I spoke at 14 events. These were conferences, meetups
and even paid speaking assignments at company events.

I would never have thought when starting this journey, one day I would be paid
by companies to present.

The highs of 2018 were speaking at [Agile India](https://2018.agileindia.org/),
[NCrafts](http://ncrafts.io/) and
[Lean Agile Scotland](https://leanagile.scot/2018/). As said, I have the
tendency to put some conferences on a pedestal.

The absolute high was
[CodeMotion Milan 2018](https://milan2018.codemotionworld.com/).

> Finally, I managed to get "Feature Branching considered Evil" accepted at a
> pure developer-oriented conference. That will be the very first time!
>
> I will be speaking end of November at #Codemotion Milan
> [@CodemotionIT](https://twitter.com/CodemotionIT)
>

>
> -- Thierry de Pauw, [Sep 26, 2018](https://twitter.com/tdpauw/status/1045043533693022208)

I've tried many times to submit "*Feature Branching is Evil*" at what I call
pure developer oriented conferences like NDC, OreDev, Devoxx, BuildStuff.
In my humble opinion, this the audience that needs hear this. As opposed to
agile, XP or software-crafts conferences where I have the impression to preach
in front of the convinced. But, "*Feature Branching is Evil*" was always
rejected. I do not know why. Obviously you do not receive any feedback from
these conferences.

I do not mind being rejected. I do mind not receiving any feedback because of
the fallacy reason "*we have received too many proposals*". I get it, it takes
time to reply to every submitter. But that is the least you could do to show
some respect for the time these persons have put into crafting a proposal for
your conference.

I remember [Steve Smith](https://twitter.com/SteveSmith_Tech) making a point of
personally informing each and every submitter why they were not selected for
PIPELINE Conference.

Never mind, CodeMotion Milan was an outright success. They scheduled me in
the smallest room. I remember thinking at the time: "*I can imagine in this kind
of conference less people will be interested*".

> Thierry de Pauw live in very shortly at Room 3. Make sure to get down to the
> stages early as places fill up fast 🚀 🙋‍♀️ 🙋‍♂️
> [@CodemotionIT](https://twitter.com/CodemotionIT)

>
> -- Codemotion, [Nov 29, 2018](https://twitter.com/CodemotionIT/status/1068159252806680576)

That room was jam-packed. People were sitting on the floor in front of the
stage. Others were standing the back! 😳 Afterwards, I learned the room had a
capacity of 300 seats. 300 seats! 😳

2018 was also the year I learned, to avoid submitting an abstract for which you
have no material yet and you know upfront you will not have the time to put
together a presentation. [Seb Rose](https://twitter.com/sebrose) nudged me to
propose a follow up to "*Feature Branching is Evil*" with code examples to XP
Conference 2018 and Agile 2018. Guess what? They both got selected 🤦‍♂️ There I
was. At long last, I decided to cancel both. That was a painful experience.

## Expand Conf 2019: Continuous Delivery for 15 teams and there single monolith

It is only late 2019 I came up with a new subject thanks to
[Jeffrey Fredrick](https://twitter.com/Jtf) and
[Douglas Squirrel](https://twitter.com/douglassquirrel):
[*Continuous Delivery for 15 teams and there single monolith*]({% link _talks/15-teams-1-monolith-4-months-to-achieve-continuous-delivery.md %})

That year I organised [CITCON 2019](https://citconf.com/archive/ghent2019/)
in my home town, Ghent. Jeffrey is the founder of CITCON together with
[Paul Julius](https://twitter.com/PaulJulius) (aka PJ). Douglas (aka Squirrel)
is a long time attendee of CITCON. Together with Jeffrey they are the authors of
the book [Agile Conversations](https://www.conversationaltransformation.com/agile-conversation-book/).

Squirrel did a session on Agile War stories. One of the attendees mentioned the
work I was doing at the agency he was working for. At the time I was
helping a federal public agency adopting Continuous Delivery for 15 teams
all working on that single monolith. Continuous Delivery was achieved in less
than 4 months.

Squirrel immediately grabbed me asking: "*How did you manage their fear?*".
This became the fear conversation case in their book Agile Conversations. Proud!

## Agile Tour Vilnius 2020: I have 99 Problems. Where do I start? Theory of Constraints applied

At SoCraTes Germany 2019, my dear friend
[Tobias Goeschel](https://twitter.com/w3ltraumpirat) and I gave an
improvised introductory session to Theory of Constraints. That got quite some
attention. After the session, we thought we should turn this into a real
presentation and present this at conferences. It took some time to realise this.
But eventually, we presented this at three online conferences at the end of
2020 and beginning of 2021. The first was
[Agile Tour Vilnius 2020](http://2020.agileturas.lt/vilnius/).

Being the two of us presenting is extremely reassuring. Far less stressful than
presenting on your own.

Preparing that presentation was lots of fun. Tobias and I met each other at
[SoCraTes France](https://socrates-fr.github.io/) in 2016. A click happened. We
enjoy the conversations we have together. Ever since, we met each other at least
once a year at SoCraTes France. This is another beautiful friendship I deeply
care of.

## Final Thoughts

Looking back, this was quite a journey. It unlocked experiences
I would never had ran into, had I never submitted my very first proposal in
2015 to Agile Tour Brussels.

I have been invited to speak at several conferences. For an imposter,
this is quite an experience. It really boosts your ego. I can use that.

During that time, I have been asked to review two books. One of my work
experiences is mentioned as a case in another book.

I have travelled a lot. Spoken with lots of interesting people. I have seen lots
of places. I am delighted about what I have accomplished. But, I am also tired.
2021 will be a break. At least, that is the plan.

Over these five years, I have spoken at 30 conferences and another 13 meetups
and private company events. Though, I have spoken so many times. Though, some
see me as an experienced speaker. I still do not get used to it. I am still
freaking out to the idea of speaking public. But, it is worth the
investment.

## Acknowledgment

To Els, the one I love since I am 15 years, who made all of this possible.
Thank you my love!
