In 2023, [Yves Hanoulle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yveshanoulle/) interviewed me for his [Who is Agile](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5eAvwhjCQFcrkDJT5A-pQ6Qd1E18qZ9C) series. Yves asked for an interview quite early in his journey. But I hold it off because I was in a bad place. I have nothing positive, energising to share. Eventually, I accepted. Yves was expecting a tech interview. Non of that happened. It ended up being a three hour long, comfy, very personal interview. We went on and on.
