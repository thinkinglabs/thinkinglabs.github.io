On the [Evilness of Feature Branching]({% post_url 2021-04-26-on-the-evilness-of-feature-branching %}) and subsequent articles mentioned several times how trunk-based development is a superior delivery approach to any of its alternatives. Every single article declines some of its benefits. But the benefits are scared around. This summarises the value of trunk-based development.

Although, trunk-based development is implied by the practice of Continuous Integration. Although, it has been reported since 2015 by the State of DevOps report and later by the book Accelerate to lead to higher IT delivery performance. Although, organisations like Microsoft, Netflix and Google practice trunk-based development. In the case of Google at extremely large scale In 2016 we were speaking about 16.000 engineers working from a single trunk with 25.000 changes per day. It is still the most controversial practice in the IT industry.

Any time we suggest trunk-based development we are called unprofessional followed by belittling. In all honesty, ...

If we are committing more frequently into a remote mainline ...

... we produce more frequent builds.

If we produce more frequent builds ...

... we can deploy more frequently.

If we can deploy more frequently ...

... we significantly reduce time to market and cost of delay.

If we can deploy more frequently ...

... we accelerate feedback. We can run more experiments in production.

If we can run more experiments ...

... we can find more unmet needs of our users. We can find more ways to delight the user. This increases customer satisfaction exponentially. In the end, it allows the organisation to make more money.

If we can build more frequently ...

... we will uncover more problems sooner ...

... allowing us to fix them when they are still small and easy to fix.

This enables us to Build Quality Into the product instead of testing quality later.

In the end, together with accelerated feedback this leads to better quality.

Trunk-based development predicts better quality and higher delivery throughput, shorter times to market, reduced cost of delay.
