Last week, I delivered my [Shades of Conway's Law]({% post_url 2023-08-25-shades-of-conways-law %}) talk at [Domain Driven Design Europe](https://dddeu.org). During the session, I mention the [Inverse Conway Manoeuvre](http://jonnyleroy.com/2011/02/03/dealing-with-creaky-legacy-platforms/). One of the points I make is that the Inverse Conway Manoeuvre works for greenfield or flexible systems. But it will not work on long-lived, rigid systems because of the Reverse Conway's Law. Despite that, I still got the question, do you think an Inverse Conway Manoeuvre would still be possible for a long-lived system?

First of all, as a disclaimer, I do not have experience with the Inverse Conway Manoeuvre. I have never applied it. What follows, is my vision on how I would attack this.
