From my experience working with tech leaders, I am baffled by the limited knowledge they have about managing teams and delivering tech products as well as their relatively conservative ideas. If we do not want to be such a tech leader, I suggest the following list of books.

## [Radical Candor](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/75293562-75d4-4aed-a370-d4a0c832e562) by Kim Malone Scot

My friend [Ringo De Smet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ringodesmet/) gave me a copy of the book, telling me, "*You have to read this!*". And it stayed another year or two in my library until this year. Shame on me.

I have rarely read "management books" because most of them are bullshit. But Radical Candor is so refreshing by the ideas and Kim's way of writing, which is kind of vulnerable and very open. She shared her mistakes and what she learned from it.

Radical Candor is about how not to be a terrible boss humiliating people thinking that will motivate them. Resonates? Right. Instead bosses should care personally (but genuinely caring, not the *Manipulative Insincerity*), challenging directly, **soliciting criticism to improve your leadership**, and providing guidance to grow the team.

To be radical candid start by asking the team to criticise you, as a leader, before criticising them. Then start with praise before critique.

Also, a team needs both rockstars and superstars. Rockstars are the ones going deep into a craft not interested in changing jobs. They are stability. That is fine! Superstars are the ones that need steep growth. That is fine too! Both do different jobs.

## [Good to Great](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/1771dbe4-16a3-4316-83a1-ed2b21984bc9) by Jim Collins

Most great companies have always been great. They never had to turn themselves from good to great companies. They had founders who shaped the greatness character early on. The vast majority of good companies remain just that, good, but not great. 

Can a good company become great?

Jim Collins, and his research team, did a five year research identifying 11 US companies that went from good to great, beating the market 4 to 18 times (more than Intel, GE, Walt Disney, Coca-Cola, Hewlett-Packard, Wal-Mart, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson who only beat the market 2,5 times). They identified underlying variables that enable an organisation to make the leap.

The book is quite revealing as it uncovers the distinguishing factors that enable an organisation to make the leap.
