This article describes a personal case study on how my wife and I used a lean principle to avoid a decision having a somehow dramatic consequence.

Recently, [Yves Hanoulle](https://agilealliance.social/@YvesHanoulle) interviewed me for his [Who is Agile](https://www.hanoulle.be/book/who-is-agile/) [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSNP9LGA1WA&list=PL5eAvwhjCQFcrkDJT5A-pQ6Qd1E18qZ9C). Yves has this favourite question he fancies asking.

> Do you have a personal agility tip to share?

Without hesitation, I shared "Defer Decision to the Last Responsible Moment". It is one of the [seven lean principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development#Lean_principles).

Professionally, I live by this principle. I have repeatedly been battling with people: "*No, we are not going to implement this right now*". "*But, but â€¦ it is part of the requirements. We know we have to provide this flexibility*". "*Yes, that can be, but we do not need it right now. We will do that at the time it is needed*". I have implemented flexibility far too many times too early to know it is a pure waste of time, energy and a money drainer.

But not only professionally, it is also fairly present in my personal life. Even so that my wife follows the same principle. She actively searches together with me for ways to defer decisions in our private life. Can we not take this decision right now? We do not have enough information. How can we gain time? How can we postpone that decision?

It is also something we try to pass on to our children. It is quite a game changer for life. I have not learned this as a kid or young adult. It is only when reading the books from [Mary and Tom Poppendieck](http://www.poppendieck.com/), [Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/194338), that I discovered this. I loved it. It simplifies life so much. It is unimaginable. But few people follow me in this.

Naturally, Yves asked for an example from my personal life. I have a massive one. It is happening right here, right now. But the question took me by surprise. I was not prepared to share this. Because it is rather personal. Few people know this. More importantly, I had not talked this through with my wife. Is it ok to share this? It is our life. So, I kindly declined the question. But it kept nagging. I felt I missed an occasion to show the world a different way of thinking. After much thought, I thought the time was come to share this.

Because of personal battles, my wife and I are somewhat isolated. We do not have friends nearby upon which we can rely on. It brought us to do everything on our own and to only rely on ourselves. That worked, if you can say this, not too bad until having children. But well ... not something we would say that gives a lot of joy. On the contrary, a lot of sadness and loneliness draw our lives.

Raising two children on our own, just the two of us, is quite demanding. The pandemic drove everything to extremes. Now we were even more lonely, with barely any people to rely on. Well, to tell the truth, nobody. It has been the one thing too much. It left deep scars on our couple.

Eventually, last November, we decided to separate to give each other space. We sincerely did not know what to do, what the future would bring, or what this experience would bring, ... We had not seen this coming. Though we each knew for two years something was wrong and that something had to happen. Well, truthfully, some of my best friends knew better than me that something was wrong. I guess I did not want to see this.

Now you are asking, what has all this to do with this agility tip? Well, everything.

Naturally, people would think we would divorce. However, we did not want to take irreversible decisions. Divorcing has a considerable impact on the whole family, certainly emotionally but also financially and not a bit. We did not desire that. So, how could we defer that decision?

We decided I would leave the house. I would look for a temporary living for two months. That would allow both of us to find the dearly needed space. Space we each craved for.

Finding a temporary living solution to rent by the month is a reasonable endeavour. Though Ghent is regarded as the most progressive city in Belgium, it is not the capital. There are not many businesses and ex-pats in Ghent requiring a temporary living.

I managed to find a business flat, a furnished apartment, that we could rent by the month. We first rented for two months. It is a loft in the attic of an old mansion. The owners live on the ground and first floors. They are these charming, considerate people. I feel really at home.

A business flat is a damned expensive thing. How is that a good thing? We did not have to invest in furniture that we maybe later did not need any more. We did not have to take a gas, electricity, water and Internet subscription. That is all included in the business flat. But more importantly, we did not have to commit to a yearly rent. We could rent as we went. Also, I did not have to endure the usual patronising experience going together with renting an apartment: proving antecedents, earnings and all those sorts of power dynamics. It would certainly not have helped in the mental situation I was in. Access to those kinds of apartments is far less complicated. It is merely a business transaction. No power-constructs bullshit.

We soon realised that two months was too short. Especially, as this was all happening around the holiday season. We shortly extended the rent to three months.

Meanwhile, a dear friend of both of us, an amazing one we met at [Codefreeze](https://codefreeze.fi/), offered to mediate between us. It allowed us to see our needs clearly and feel heard. We started to date again. Something we have, as a matter of fact, never been able to do when we were young because we had to fight for basic needs. It helped us getting again closer to each other and having fun again.

Eventually, we extended the rent for another three months bringing it to six months in total. Shortly after prolonging, we saw clear. We decided to stay a couple because we still have a lot of love and care for each other. But we each need our space. Thus, we decided we would keep living apart. However, we would still be having activities together as a family and going on holidays together.

Now we could look for a more definitive living solution for me as we now knew what was needed. Meanwhile, we found a lovely apartment.

Deferring the decision allowed us to gain time to see clearer. It avoided having to take the expensive, irreversible decision of divorcing. Eventually, it even helped us to cancel the apparent decision to divorce.
