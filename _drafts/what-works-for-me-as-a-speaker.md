Recently, I was speaking at [ScanAgile](https://www.scan-agile.org/), the biggest Scandinavian agile conference. ScanAgile is on a mission to increase diversity and attract more new speakers, which is laudable. So, they asked us, the speakers, for tips and tricks on how to become a successful speaker. Two things about this. First, what does it mean being a successful speaker? What is that? I do not have the answer to that. For what it is worth, I do not think I am a successful one. Though, I guess, people would argue differently. Second, I feel tips and tricks comes across as patronising. It lacks context. What works for one person does not necessarily work for someone else. In that regard, I prefer sharing what works for me as a speaker and what I look for when I used to be part of a conference review committee. Your mileage may vary.

## Submitting a proposal

Before becoming a speaker, it all starts with submitting a proposal. To me, that is already quite an achievement. I am not particularly prosaic. Writing is demanding.

Well, as it happens, it all starts with an idea. Often people think they have nothing to share. Before speaking, I also thought that. But in reality, everyone has a story to share from what they have experienced in their teams or organisation that is, in all likelihood, worth telling. Chances are, we have even more stories to share. Real world case studies have a lot of potential at conferences. But it could also be something we are passionate about. That we have dived deep into.

Once we have the idea, then comes the proposal. It all begins with the title. It needs to draw attention and gain the interest of the reviewer. In all honesty, as a reviewer, the title makes the difference on whether I am interested in the topic or not. It sounds stupid, I give you that. The thing is, we do this in our limited spare time. I have heard, indirectly, that for some reviewers the title and the first sentences of the proposal are defining. Some stop there if they were not convinced. Personally, I have never done that. I have always given every proposal the benefit of the doubt. But, I admit, if the title did not convince me, I did read the remainder of the proposal. But, that was through coloured glasses. Which is not fair. I agree. So, that's that.

As a side note, what I share here as a reviewer is what I pay attention too. I do not know what other reviewers look for. I have never had any reviewer training whatsoever. If that even exists. When reviewing proposals I am looking for two things. Either I look for novelty, being surprised. Or someone brings a success-story of a practice that is most often badly implemented. Think OKRs. Or a reconfirmation of old technical practices because they still lack adoption.

For the abstract, it is important to start from the problem definition. That is the secret sauce [Johanna Rothman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannarothman/) learned me. Then provide a glimpse of the solution without revealing too much of the solution. One other advise I have often received from people reviewing my abstract is to provide a closing sentence that invites people to attend the session. Something that inspires attendees for their own situation. It avoids the abstract ends too abruptly.

The other thing I like to see, as a reviewer, is an outline or a timeline of the session. It helps to build an idea on whether the session will be well structured and organised. How it will be delivered? Which topics will be covered? The timeline does not need to be precise. Of course, if we have never given the session before, it is fairly difficult to provide. But then again, it is just to have an idea. An outline will also be good enough. Now, it is not always possible to provide that information. Not all conferences have a notes or additional information for reviewers section. Some have only an abstract field. Nothing more. Which is not helpful. I give you that too.

Lastly, it is important to provide key takeaways. It gives reviewers an idea of what attendees will get out of the session. But, also when the session is accepted, it helps attendees to understand what they will get out of the session.

Before sending submitting a proposal, it helps to ask for feedback. I still ask for feedback for some of my abstracts. I remember, when I started, that was not so easy. I did not have the network I have now, thanks to the speaking. Back in the days, there was this lovely initiative HelpMeAbstract. Speakers offered there help to review abstracts. That helped me a lot. But it seems, unfortunately, that does not exist anymore.

Some conferences offer reviews as part of the submission process. Make use of that. It does make a difference. [XP Days Benelux](https://xpdaysbenelux.org/), [XP Conference](https://www.agilealliance.org/xp2024/) and [Agile20xx](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile2024/) do that.

## How to become a good speaker

Again, what does it mean to be a good speaker? I do not know if, in the end, I am a good speaker. But, over time I have developed a certain speaking habit.

I used to submit an abstract about a vague idea. Many speakers do that. It follows the lean principle. Do not invest too much upfront for unknown value in return. Once selected I started developing the idea in bullet points. Often, each bullet point is a slide. This then becomes a script. But, eventually, that became too stressful. I usually had the plan to start two months in advance. Which never happened. Because of procrastination.

Nowadays, I try to have an article before even sending an abstract. However, most of the time the article is not enough to fill a presentation. So it needs more research. It gives structure, but it still requires additional work to prepare the presentation. I am still caught by procrastination.

In the week before the conference I start practising out loud, like for the whole house. My kids find this very funny. Practising out loud allows me to detect errors in the flow and slide transitions and in the wordings.

As some of my friends know, I am not particularly keen on public speaking. I am pretty shy and introverted, but I keep doing this. In front of a speaking engagement, I feel miserable. Why am I doing this? But once I finished speaking, I am like "When is the next one?".

Over the years, I adopted several coping mechanisms.

Because I have trouble finding words on the spot, I have to practice a great deal to memorise the script as much as possible. For some of my talks I know the script completely by heart. This gives me great flexibility.

To feel at ease on stage, I need to walk around on the stage. I feel awkward if I just stand still in front of the audience. I need to be busy when speaking. Knowing the script by heart helps for that. Also, I gesticulate a lot. So, handheld microphones are a nightmare.

This might sound silly. But, I like to go on the stage of the room I will be speaking at, early in the morning, when it is still empty. So, I can feel and absorb the room. How big is the stage? How much room I have to walk around? Does the lecture stand have room for a glass of water? Where is the lecture stand on the stage? In the middle? On the side? How far can I walk away, in case I have a black out?

Lastly, before speaking I do stretching exercises to circulate the blood. Last year, a public speaking coach shared with me they actually advise that to new speakers, but nobody does that. So, he was surprised to see me doing that.

The hours before speaking, I go nuts. Eating is somewhat impossible. However, I do drink coffee before. In the 15 minutes before speaking, my heart beats like crazy. I try to keep that under control by listening to music. And then it starts. It is like jumping into the unknown. But, once I start speaking, I am in a kind of flow. I am not aware of what happens in the room. I do scan the audience for the confirming nods and keep eye contact with these people.

Do not forget to start the timer. It happened to me all to often I forgot to start the timer. It is troublesome as I am constantly worried. Am I still on time? That is a crazy experience. Of course, there are time keepers in the room. But, it is quite tense when they announce ten minutes left when you know you still have to cover 15 minutes of material. The next time, I need to have a sticky note on my laptop "*Start the timer!*".

To me, the fun part are the questions at the end and the attention. But that is not the case for everyone. It is your choice whether to take questions at the end or not. My friend, [Steve Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevesmithtech/), makes it a point at every conference he is involved with "*Make sure your question is a question and not a statement!*". I am thankful to him he does that.

## Closing thoughts

It is ok to make mistakes when speaking. That is being human. But yes, when attending conferences I also had that irrational believe speakers are these flawless humans. That is not true! It happened to me to have a complete black out when I was at the complete opposite side of a 20 meter wide stage from my laptop. I just told the audience I have a blackout and walked towards my laptop. Attendees are extremely forgiving. Of course, if this happened in my early days, I would have wanted to sink through the floor and disappear.

In closing, to increase your chances to be selected, I advise to submit to conference that do blind reviews, i.e. reviewers do not see names or genders, they only see a title, an abstract and additional information for reviewers. From what I have seen, these conferences seem to have a higher diversity rate and more first time speakers.
