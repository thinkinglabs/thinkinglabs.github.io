A quote from a recent client: “We don’t do the important stuff…because we won't do anything that is NOT our OKRs”. Also: “OKRs give me performance anxiety :-(”

OKR = **Object and Key Results**

very much a buzzword

before they were called goals or MBO (management by objective)

## Hype, hype, hype

Google, Netflix, Deliveroo use OKRs

they are so great at creating alignment amongst teams and focus

and yet this is what we hear

- we do not do the important stuff ... because we won't do anything that is NOT our OKR
- we never achieve our OKRs ... they are too ambitious -> performance anxiety, bonus pay
- can't figure out the right metrics ... and then how to even measure these, example customer satisfaction

Good OKRs emerge when the company culture is already focused on

- radical focus: only doing one thing at the org level
- team alignment
- impact
- have transparency (who receives a bonus and who not, what payrate)
- have engagement

you already need all of these before adopting OKRs

We can be successful if ...

- we focus on shaping a culture of (the above)
- we have a common understanding of what "good" OKRs mean

## Create a common understanding

OKRs are a goal-setting experimentation methodology
... and NOT a work or performance management methodology!!!

decouple performance management from OKRs then you can actually experiment with it

OKRs ask 3 questions

- where do I want to go? Objectives
- how do I know I'm getting there? Key Results
- what do I think are the next steps? Experiments -> very much incremental

less than 10% of experiments succeed! -> it's important to define experiments well

> Really enjoying this talk by [@oliphantism](https://twitter.com/oliphantism) - seeing [#OKRs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OKRs) as experiments rather than performance management.

## How we set OKRs?

- Figure out your OKRs capacity -> because OKRs don't capture **all** work
- Set your company OKR -> so the most important strategic outcome is clear
- Set your team OKR -> so all teams know what impact they'll have on the strategic outcome
- Experiment, learn, adapt

### OKRs capacity

considerations to take:

- how much debt?
- how reactive?
- how to innovate?

how much time is spent on:

- Maintenance: 40%? (BAU, technical debt, monitoring, support, ...)
- Optimisation: 30%? (monitor and optimise existing propositions and journeys)
- OKRs: 30%? (discover, test and deliver new propositions and fundamental journey changes)

not all OKRs will necessarily come from your company OKR
some OKRs will come from the team itself

### Company OKR

a good practice to use both company OKRs and team OKRs

ideally one or two company objectives, typically for 6 months to max 1 year -> a couple of OKRs

the teams that impact the company objective derive their OKR from the company objective

the other teams define their own OKRs

company OKR will either focus on:

- something valuable for the customer
- company revenue: that is more problematic for teams to know how to have an impact
- something valuable for the investors: plan an IPO

### Team OKR

...

### Experiment, learn, adapt

3 buckets of work

- BAU
- Maintenance
- OKR

you need to understand the cadence of all 3 buckets of work

on daily, weekly, monthly and yearly reviews we need to celebrate all 3 types of work

often orgs forget to celebrate BAU and Maintenance and only speak about OKR

## Take away

- do we have a common/consistent definition of OKR?

  -> can we set good OKRs

- are we measuring our current capacity?
- can we do all of our work, do we have permission to also work on something else than OKRs, can we keep leadership away from teams because we trust teams
- can we experiment well
- do we get rewarded if we do the right thing, or are we punished if we did the wrong bad

  -> the response of leadership teams towards failure is really important for the successful adoption of OKR
