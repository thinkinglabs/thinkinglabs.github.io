> Bravo Sara! Très important le brag doc! Quand tu as un coup de mou ou que tu t’interroge sur ta contribution ou impact, le relire permet de se re-étalonner. Moi, c’est un témoignage de @b0rk qui m’a encouragé à démarrer 😉

Lean Agile Scotland 2023

> Epic talk by Thierry de Pauw about Conways Law or rather the relationship between system and organisations architecture
>
> #systemdesign #Transformation #changemangement
>

> How often do we restructure our organisation without redesigning our product architecture?
>
> ALWAYS
>
> and yet we wonder why reorgs don’t result in fundamental changes in delivery - throughput, outcomes, all the things
>
> Org structures and ops models need to co-evolve with product architecture
>
> And yet we don’t bring architects into org design discussions
>
> We also don’t tend to start small, we design orgs and architecture big, upfront
>
> So much to think about with this fantastic talk by Thierry de Pauw #lascot
>
