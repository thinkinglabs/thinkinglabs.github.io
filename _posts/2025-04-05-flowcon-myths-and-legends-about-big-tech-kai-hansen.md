Is working in Big Tech really like the movies? Do Big Tech engineers have infinite budgets and free rein? Does "10x" talent actually exist?

Over more than a decade inside Google, I was part of the myths, the hype, and the reality. In this session, we’ll separate fact from fiction - starting with the biggest myths about working in Big Tech (bring your own questions!). Then, we’ll break down what truly makes these companies thrive: people over process, smart constraints, trust over bureaucracy, and why forgiveness is more powerful than permission.

If you want to learn what actually drove the success of Big Tech - and how to apply it anywhere - this talk is for you.

- Apple is a product company, product first, marketing second and then someone needs to do the job
- Microsoft was a business company
- Google is an engineering company, founded by engineers, owned by engineers

We are not big tech, we are not Amazon, Google, does not apply to us. No. Not true.

## BigTech's success is primarily driven by bottom-up ideas

plausible

there were lots of bottom up ideas, but we need somebody that takes decisions at the top

## The food is great

confirmed

but win-win

We will treat you well but expects from their employees they work their ass well -> you never have to think of laundry, food, ... keeps you focussed

## BigTech collects a lot of data which is a privacy problem

plausible

but spend an insane amount of time in making sure privacy is ok

Google created a privacy team in Munich, Germany (the most privacy conscious country)

they do not mean mean

US BigTech were founded on that idea, Amazon goes crazy into that

the amount of bureaucracy at Google to collect data is insane so nobody does it and develop a product without collecting data

## BigTech works like a well-oiled machine, everything perfectly fit together

busted, not true

Building products is a little bit like going to the moon

- very unpredictable: Europeans tend to like predictability and don't like risks, this is what BigTech has figured out well, invent their way through the web

We need a plan, and need to tell it to people -> Overall Strategic Guidance

overarching strategy -> enables teams to make aligned, decentralised decisions, and understand how their work contributes to the bigger picture

-> Transparent Goal Setting: to ensure objectives cascade through the org

-> Resource Allocation

## Team Structure is extremely important

Clear Missions and Scope: each team knowns exactly why they are a team -> clear, unambiguous mission, essential to prevent overlap

Autonomy in Execution -> make teams autonomous, enable them to decide alone, if they ask, they are blocked

Balanced Decision-Authority Making

## Trust!!!

effective communication in complex environments relies more on robust communication than rigid processes to make progress against complex strategies goals

## Selective Use of Formal Processes

for most day-to-day collaboration, alignment and problem-solving, direct communication leads to better results

we ran Google Maps on docs and sheets for 10 years

## Outcome is what matters, not output

Outcome Orientation: avoid maximising activity

Course Correction

experiment, learn and adapt, preventing wasted effort

Individual Responsibility

focusing on outcome clarifies the why behind the work, enhancing team purpose and ownership

defining missions by impact allows teams greater autonomy in determining the how, boosting creativity and motivation as they connect their efforts to meaningful results.

-> I felt responsible with the outcome, that is why I worked 60-70 hours per week

## Having Data beats having an opinion

Ubiquitous Data

requires commitment to pragmatic processes, responsible usage and privacy safeguards enabling data insights

Evidence-Based Thinking

Data-Informed, Not Data-Driven

data comes into the conversation
shared evidence that can inform discussions

## It's OK to make Mistakes

Take Calculated Risks

proactive initiative and calculated risks, progress often require action over obedience

Learn From Your Mistakes

learning opportunities, not failures, accountability without blame

Invest in Experimentation

allocate resources for experimentation and "wild bets"

Street View: they had a VW van with open slide door trying to see how fast they can click the shutter, showed it to Larry, he found it amazing, granted 5 million

accept that some initiatives will fail, view this as a necessary investment in discovery and potential breakthroughs, not just a cost

sunk-cost fallacy!! is a terrible thing

I brought down Google Search (during 3 mins) -> caused a 20 page post mortem and caused 15 processes to change

## Takeaways

The only constant in life is Change

Constant Refinement

requires cycles of learning and adapting, not rigid process adherence, use data-fueled evidence

no flow chart, no three year roadmap, we may have to throw away the thing we started last year

Adaptable Structures

frequently adapt team structures, Google re-org every 6-9 months

Kill Your Darlings

avoid attachment to current solutions or sunk costs

Some snippets

- what problem are we solving?
- clear and complete missions
- don't ship the org chart
- people over process
- ask for forgiveness, not for permission
- ...

Takeaways:

- BigTech is not perfect
- Guidance & Adaptability
- Empowered & Aligned Teams
- Communication & Outcome Focus
- Culture of Learning & Informed Risks
