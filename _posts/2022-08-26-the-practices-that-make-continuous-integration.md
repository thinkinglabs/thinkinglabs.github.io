Continuous Integration is by itself already a practice. It is one of the most critical to adopt to enable the fast flow of work through the value stream. However, many teams believe Continuous Integration is just a tooling problem, to then say they practice Continuous Integration.

Though they often do not and hence miss out on the benefits that come along with it. This session goes deeper into the practices that each on their own enables Continuous Integration. Learn how to gain fast feedback, increased stability and higher throughput!

Key takeaways:

- Be able to define what a state of Continuous Integration is
- Be able to enumerate the practices required to achieve Continuous Integration
- Be able to understand the practices
