Back in October 2019, [Vasco Duarte](https://twitter.com/duarte_vasco) wanted
to perform a bonus series on Continuous Delivery for the [Scrum Master Toolbox
Podcast](https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/). By chance, I got part of this
series.

Vasco wanted to interview actual practitioners that have been in the trenches
implementing Continuous Delivery. For some mysterious reason,
[Oskari Porkka](https://twitter.com/oporkka) mentioned my name.

So, here I was, [honoured to be interviewed by Vasco](https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/2019/12/podcast/bonus-thierry-de-pauw-interview-continuous-delivery-for-scrum-teams-part-2/).
During the interview, we cover many aspects:

* How I got into trunk-based development and later Continuous Delivery;
* How Theory of Constraints can help with the adoption of Continuous Delivery;
* How to kickstart a Continuous Delivery program with The Improvement Kata.

During this bonus podcast series on Continuous Delivery, I was actually in
excellent company. Vasco has other episodes with:

* [Dave Farley](https://scrum-master-toolbox.org/2019/12/podcast/bonus-dave-farley-interview-continuous-delivery-for-scrum-teams-part-1/)
