Your IT organisation is surrounded by problems preventing it to satisfy market demand on time with the required quality. Where do you start?

35 years ago, Eliyahu Goldratt introduced the Theory of Constraints in his seminal book "The Goal" as a new management paradigm to running manufacturing plants. Back then, manufacturing plants had similar problems: The production work floor was surrounded by inventory, resulting in late deliveries having poor quality. The Theory of Constraints solved that problem for manufacturing by introducing the five focusing steps - a guideline to systematic improvement and continuous learning.

Today, the Theory of Constraints is one of the underlying foundations for the DevOps movement. It hasn't lost any of its potential for organising thought, and as a driver for continuous improvement.

During this session, we will present the basic principles of the Theory of Constraints, and how it applies to the software industry. It will be a mix of theory, related stories and experiences, and practical advice applicable to the day-to-day work of an IT department.
