Without knowing how or where to provide higher-level vision, strategy and flow management, leaders often find themselves working at the operational level, or, using the metaphor of “flight levels,” in a state of "level collapse."

It's a double-whammy productivity killer because it strips people working at the operational level (Level 1) of their autonomy and empowerment, but it also impoverishes the coordination and strategic levels (Levels 2 and 3), where end-to-end and intent-based leadership is desperately needed in order for operational activities to thrive.

This talk reveals ways to identify "level collapse" behaviors (perhaps even in yourself!) and generative ways to rise out of Level 1 and provide important and necessary leadership at Levels 2 and 3.

Level Collapse: when managers do less than what they should do

when managers work below their intended organisational level, neglecting higher-level strategic and coordination responsibilities for lower-level operational tasks

Flight Levels, like a plane at different heights

- level 3: strategy
- level 2: coordination
- level 1: operational

mental model to see what happens in the organisation

we need leadership at all these levels

How to recognise the symptoms of a Level Collapse?

- managers consistently doing work that should be delegated
- lack of long term planning
- team members not understanding direction or strategy

Isn't this simply micromanagement?
