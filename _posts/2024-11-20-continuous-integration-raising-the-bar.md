So we implemented Continuous Integration. It gives us the confidence to deliver - great! However, we are in a suboptimal situation and we do not gain all the benefits.

Continuous Integration is one of the most critical practices to adopt to enable the fast flow of work through the value stream. How can we bring our delivery process to the highest standard and reap all the benefits of Continuous Integration?

This session goes deeper into the advanced practices to raise Continuous Integration to a higher level. Learn how to gain fast feedback, increased stability and higher throughput with reduced stress and fatigue!
