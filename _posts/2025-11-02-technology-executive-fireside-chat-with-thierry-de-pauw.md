I was once more humbled to be invited by [David Subar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidsubar/) in [Interna's Thought Leaders Podcast]() to talk about everything Continuous Integration, Product Management, branching strategies, testing, how to go bankrupt with a bogus Feature Toggle implementation and mentoring junior engineers.

> #Microsoft's #CoPilot, and #Amazon’s #CodeWhisperer (now Q), are great for a senior developer but are like putting a chainsaw in the hands of a toddler for someone without mature coding skills. How will we train new developers in the world of hashtag#GenAI? In this clip from the #InternaThoughtLeaders podcast, Thierry de Pauw tells us why everything old is new again.

In the latest episode of "The Thought Leaders Podcast", host David Subar welcomes software development strategist Thierry de Pauw to delve into one of the most misunderstood topics in software development today, feature branching. For many, feature branching versus trunk/mainline development seems like a solved problem, but as with many things that are thought solved, the solutions are poorly implemented. Thierry takes us through the difference between feature branching and mainline development and tells us how feature branching is not a panacea but it is an impediment.

Thierry de Pauw brings a rich background in electromechanical engineering and continuous development consulting, providing a fresh perspective on traditional software methodologies. The conversation quickly dives into the complexities of branch-based development versus trunk-based development, igniting a detailed examination of the impact these practices have on lead times, team dynamics, and overall product quality.

Moreover, Thierry touches on an often-overlooked aspect of software development: the human element. He discusses the importance of senior developers mentoring newcomers, the transformative potential of practices like pairing and mob programming, and how these can be integrated into different organizational cultures. Particularly intriguing is his take on the evolving role of software engineers in the age of AI and code generation tools. How does one balance the benefits of automation with the invaluable human touch in coding?
