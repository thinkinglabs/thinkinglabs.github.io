We see the world through the lens of all our experiences. This is probably obvious to most, but what is probably less apparent is that we also carry a coherent mental model of how we expect the world around us to behave. A preconceived notion of what to expect in any given situation, one that even goes beyond the basic laws of nature and common human behaviour. It is so ingrained that we do not know we even have it until made aware of it. Like do you assume predictability because science assumes determinism, or do you accept unpredictability because everything is contextual?

In this talk, we will have a look at some of these lenses, called world hypothesis, and we will explore how profoundly different we interpret the world by choosing one over the other. How does it play out assuming social systems behave like machines, like when blindly copying an approach from others; or trying to create a canonical data model when all have their own context; or how about giving a team orders and designs and then expecting them to self-manage?

We shall see that the lenses are complete and should not be mixed as we constantly seem to do; to our detriment, creating massive confusion and dysfunction. Awareness of these world views and understanding their fitness in any given situation can take us a long way to make the world a better place. Imagine that.

implementing the Spotify model looks nice
that is because we have a very mechanistic view of the world

=> social science

the whole goal of natural science is to get rid of the human

## Pepper's World Hypothesis

![Pepper's World Hypothesis](/images/flowcon-seeing-the-world-through-a-different-lens-trond-hjorteland/peppers-world-hypothesis.jpg)

### Formism

root metaphor: similarity

looking for commonality

what FORMS do things take

the parts are basic, the whole derived

inadequacy in precision

Philosophers: Plato, Aristotle

Adaptability

### Mechanism

root metaphor: machine

how do things cause OTHER THINGS?

natural sciences have cheated us, they reduce everything to cause and effect

=> waterfall, delusion of control

the parts are basic, the whole derived

inadequacy in scope

Philosophers: Descartes, Lock, Hume

-> Analytical: if you understand the parts you understand the whole

Predictability

Team Topologies: Fast Flow -> mechanistic

### Organicism

root metaphor: "Organism", "integration"

a bit more vague

authority of things going on

how do things fit in a TOTALITY?

most of System Thinking is in this place

finding parts in a whole, how it effects the whole and how the whole effects the parts

Russel Ackoff, Donella Meadows are in this place

the idea is that we can model it

it's an isolated system, it does not have an environment

system's dynamics is all about that

the whole is basic, the parts are derived

Inadequacy in scope

Complicated model

Open model

Predictability

Philosophers: Shelling, Hegel

### Contextualism

root metaphor: "Historical event"

we are defined by what we have been through

what is THIS EVENT in this context?

here we have to have the environment, because the context is so important

the Spotify model worked at Spotify because it was Spotify, it was their context, we can learn from it, not replicate

there's a causal relation

Cynefin: Complicated vs Complex: Contextualism is Complex, all others are Complicated

DDD takes this Contextualism: domain model depend on context

the whole is basic, the parts are derived

inadequacy in precision

Philosophers: Pierce, James, Dewey

Complex model

Closed model

Adaptable

-> Synthetic, we start from the whole, by understanding the whole we understand the parts

Dispersive: they go out, there is no end

Integrative: we look at integration of things

every of these four are complete

they can explain the world

but they have limitations

Predictability (bottom) vs Adaptability (top)

## Open system

system is defined by environment

environment is defined by the system

the environment changes the system and the system changes the environment

different environments:

- task environment
- global environment

=> need to be actively adaptive with planning

when we learn from environment, we cannot have a forecast, a roadmap

Merrelyn Emery, Self managing management of the self managing organisations: an update

=> **Emery's Open System Theory**

## Conclusion

it helps us understand why somebody believes something strongly

we can argue till the end of the world if they are stuck in a different mental model
