[Pablo Curell Mompo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablocm90/) invited me again for his podcast [a Junior, a Senior, and I](https://open.spotify.com/show/7AMbqJv7HCdSDiTG1nvUaa) to have a conversation with my best friend [Martin Van Aken](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinvanaken/) on team practices.

Martin and I discovered each other when coaching that famous novice team from the [On the Evilness of Feature Branching - a Tale of Two Teams]({% post_url 2021-07-14-on-the-evilness-of-feature-branching-a-tale-of-two-teams %}) and [Non-Blocking Continuous Code Reviews - a Case Study]({% post_url 2024-02-06-non-blocking-continuous-code-reviews-a-case-study %}) as fellow tech coaches. That experience lead to a beautiful friendship. So, running a podcast together was heartwarming.

> I had the honor to host [Trunk-Based Thierry de Pauw](https://linkedin.com/in/tdpauw) and [Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinvanaken/) to discuss team practices for writing excellent software.

> I learned a lot from them and hope you will too!
